# express-route-mapper

Manage routes and aliases in Rails fashion. 


### Installation

    $ npm install express-route-mapper
    
### Example

Check out the example app in github repository to quickly get started

### Features:

\- Make route registration a manageable process by having routes registered in single registry file

\- Create custom alias for route

\- Retrieve route path from alias

\- Retrieve alias from path

\- Support RESTful API

*Notice*: If you register routes not using this module, retrieving route path or alias will return undefined value.

### Usage

*Include module and register all routes in app.js*

``` javascript
  app.set('routemap', require('express-route-mapper'));
  app.get('routemap').map(app, 'config');
```

Setting `routemap` local variable for View to retrieve URI from path name and aliase (See later section):

``` javascript
  app.use(function(req, res, next){
    app.locals.routemap = app.get('routemap');
    req.routemap = app.locals.routemap;
    next();
  });
```

Here we first require the module and then specify the configuration file location the module should look into under the `route` directory. You could also define your own path for both configuration file and route register file. The following setting tells Node to look into *$APP_DIR/routes/route_config_file.js* for route configuration and *$APP_DIR/routes/route_register_dir/* for all files that register route in your app.

```
  app.get('routemap').map(app, 'route_config_file', 'route_register_dir') 
```

*Resource:*

If you want to register routes for a resource then the syntax will look like this:

In `routes/config.js`
``` javascript
module.exports = [
  {resource: 'photos'}
]
```

when registering a route with resource, route mapper register all related routes following RESTful API.

The above map will register the following routes:

 Path name     |   URI        | Callbak/HTTP Method
:--------------|-------------:|:------------------:
 list_photos   |  /photos     |  index  [GET]
 show_photos   |  /photos/:id |  show   [GET]
 new_photos    |  /photos/new |  new    [GET]
 create_photos |  /photos     |  create [POST]
 update_photos |  /photos/:id |  update [PUT]
 delete_photos |  /photos/:id |  delete [DELETE]

Then in `routes/photos` you need to define the appopreate callbacks. An example would look like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  index: {
    callback: function(req, res) {
      res.send("List photos!");
    }
  }
}
```

*Custom route name and alias*

In Rails you can create route like following:

match: 'signin', to: 'session#new', via: get

Here we could do the similar things:

```javascript
{get: '/signin', to: 'session#new', as: 'signin'},
```

The above registry will map a GET request to */signin* path to the `new` callback defined in `routes/session` file.


*Retrieve URI*

Using path name or alias you can retrieve the URI which you could later change it without affecting the result. This allow you to reference to an URIs without worrying about later changes will break those links.

Give the above declaration, you could for example simply do things like the followings:

\- In Route `routes/users.js`

``` javscript
show: {
param: ':user_id',
callback: function(req, res, next) {
    if(req.session.userId != req.user_id) {
        return res.redirect(routemap.get('signin');
    }
    else {
    // Do stuff
    }
}
```

*Retrieve alias*
The following code shows how to get alias from route path:

``` javascript
  app.get('routemap').alias('/photo/:photo_id', 'get'); // show_photo
  app.get('routemap').alias('/photos', 'post'); // create_photo

```
